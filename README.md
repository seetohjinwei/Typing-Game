How fast can you type?

Requirements:
- Python3
- Tkinter module
- game.py file

Download game.py by clicking <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seetohjinwei/Typing-Game/main/game.py" target="_blank">link</a> and right click then save as.

Just run the following command:

    python3 game.py

PS: You can add a number like "python3 game.py 60" to make the games last 60 seconds instead of 30.

PPS: This script will create a file called "scores". Just keeps track of your scores between sessions.
