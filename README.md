PPPS: There is a way to activate cheat mode.

Cheat mode instructions:

1. Download "cheat.py"
2. Make sure "game.py" and "cheat.py" are in the same folder
3. Run "cheat.py" by itself to inject the cheat
4. Run with "python3 game.py cheat" when you want cheat mode. Otherwise, cheat mode will not activate.
5. If you want to modify the cheat speed, you can edit the interval timing at line 20 of "cheat.py"
